This is an individual project where I created a 3D environment and a character from scratch based on the victorian era.

## Process:
0. **References**:  
   I started by searching for references to start de project.
1. **Concept Design**:  
   I continued by creating concepts for both the 3D scene and the character to establish the overall look and feel.
2. **Modeling**:  
   - Used **SketchUp** for the environment modeling.  
   - Used **3ds Max** for character modeling.
3. **Texturing**:  
   I handled the texturing process for both the environment and the character to bring them to life.
   - Used **Substance Painter** for character texturing.

## Summary:
This project showcases my skills in **3D modeling**, **concept art**, and **texturing**.
